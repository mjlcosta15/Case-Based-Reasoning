            + "\ta) Incorrect puckup shoe for the locomotive. Replace pickup shoe.\n"
            + "\tb) The pickup shoe was incorrectly screwed onto the locomotive. Install the pickup shoe correctly.\n"
            + "\tc) An incorrect screw for mounting the pickup shoe was used. A screw with too large a head can cause short circuit. Replace screw.\n"
            + "\td) Pickup shoe is damaged. Replace pickup shoe.\n"
            + "\te) The pickup shoe is touching the frame because the springs are bent or have lost their tension. Replace pickup shoe.\n"

            + "\ta) A wire was clamped to the frame and part of its insulation destroyed when the body was screwed on. Replace wire.\n"

            + "\te) For bulbs with plastic sockets, unsolder the wires from the lamp socket's solder terminals. if the motor now works, the bare end of the wire on the side is probably too long and is bent downwards in the socket; it is touching the spring contact plate. Bend the end of the wire and screw the bulb all the way into the socket.";

            + "\tb) Is the upper part of the plastic switch lever correctly seated on the metal switching plate? Clip the switching plate under the switch lever.\n"
            + "\tc) Does the metal switching plate lie directly on the conctact plates for the lead wires? Bend the switching plate to produce a more reliable contact.If the problem is still not corrected in cases b and c, then the selector switch must be replaced. On many locomotives the selector switch is mounted to the locomotive frame with rivets. The rivets must be drilled out to remove the switch. Thenew switch can usually be installed with small screws and nuts.";
